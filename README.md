### 0. JavaScript, the Fool

Like the Fool, you tread an uncertain path, oblivious to the hazards
that lay beneath your feet. Programming language theory are but just
words you have yet to figure out the meaning of. On your way forward,
you stumbled onto this repository. A carefree action that could well
consumed all your precious time — yet you continue on, reading,
immersing yourself in the depths of this page in your endless search for
experience, knowledge. A true madman, who knows nothing, who fears
nothing.


### I. Clojure, the Magician

Power. You have finally seized such an immense amount of it that you
laugh into the void. In your hands lay the means to bridge the gap
between earth and heaven, and anything in between. As the mystical
spirits of old spoke, “You Clojure the spirits of computers with your
spells.”


### II. Lua, the High Priestess

Yet the mysteries haunt you. As you look towards the sky you can see
there's too much you can't yet grasp. The secrets here and there
whispered, hinted at, called names like “Tables.” You immerse yourself
once again, in the depths of such vision, trying to grok such amazing
structures — simple, yet intriguing.
